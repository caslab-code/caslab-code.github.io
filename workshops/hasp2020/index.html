<h2>Hardware and Architectural Support for Security and Privacy (HASP) 2020</h2>
<h3>To be held October 17, 2020 -- virtually in conjunction with MICRO 2020</h3>

<!--div class="header">Thank you for great HASP 2017</div>

<p>HASP 2017 has ended and we want to thank all the presenters and the attendees.  Presentation slides and links to paper PDFs for most of the papers are posted on the <a href="program.html">program page</a>.  We hope to see you at HASP 2018!

<p>
Although much attention has been directed to the study of security at the system and application levels, security and privacy research focusing on hardware and architecture aspects is still a new frontier. In the era of cloud computing, smart devices, and novel nano-scale devices, practitioners and researchers have to address new challenges and requirements in order to meet the ever-changing landscape of security research and new demands from consumers, enterprises, governments, defense and other industries.
</p>

<p>
HASP is intended to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry, to share practical implementations and experiences related to all aspects of hardware and architectural support for security and privacy, and to discuss future trends in research and applications. To that end, papers are solicited from the areas, including, but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Secure hardware processor architectures and implementations</li>
<li>Side-channel attacks, evaluations, and defenses</li>
<li>Secure cache designs and evaluation, focusing on side-channels</li>
<li>SGX, SEV and Trustzone based systems and security solutions</li>
<li>Hardware-enhanced cloud security</li>
<li>Hardware support for secure Internet-of-Things</li>
<li>Smartphone hardware security</li>
<li>Hardware fingerprinting and PUFs</li>
<li>Hardware and architectural support for trust management</li>
<li>Hardware trojan threat evaluation, detection, and prevention</li>
<li>Attack resilient hardware and architectural design</li>
<li>Cryptographic hardware design, implementation, and evaluation</li>
<li>Security simulation, testing, validation and verification</li>
<li>Analysis of real attacks and threat evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to regular research papers, authors are also invited to submit position 
papers or systemization-of-knowledge papers.  Position papers should define new problems 
in hardware or architecture security and privacy topics.  Titles of position papers 
should have <b>Postition Paper:</b> as their prefix.<br /><br />
Systemization-of-Knowledge papers should consicely, but exhaustively, systematize 
and conceptualize existing knowledge (similar to SoK papers in S&amp;P conferences, 
but focusing on hardware and architecture).  Titles of Systemization-of-Knowledge papers 
should have <b>SoK:</b> as their prefix.<br /><br />
Finally, researchers wishing to share their ongoing work without publishing a paper
should submit application for a Work-in-Progress presentation.  To be considered, a short
4-page paper should be submitted, with <b>WiP:</b> as the prefix to the title.  These papers
will not be published in the proceedings, but the title and authors will be listed on the
HASP web page as a public record of the presentation.
