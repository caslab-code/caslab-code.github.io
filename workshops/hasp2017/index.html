<h2>Hardware and Architectural Support for Security and Privacy (HASP) 2017</h2>
<h3>To be held Sunday, June 25, 2017 in Toronto, Canada -- in conjunction with <a href="http://isca17.ece.utoronto.ca/">ISCA 2017</a></h3>

<!--div class="header">Thank you for great HASP 2017</div>

<p>HASP 2017 has ended and we want to thank all the presenters and the attendees.  Presentation slides and links to paper PDFs for most of the papers are posted on the <a href="program.html">program page</a>.  We hope to see you at HASP 2018!
</p-->

<div class="header">Call for Papers</div>

<p><b>Tentative Call for Papers</b></p>

<p>
Although much attention has been directed to the study of security at the system and application levels, security and privacy research focusing on hardware and architecture aspects is still a new frontier. 
In the era of cloud computing, smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT), practitioners and researchers have to address new challenges and requirements in order to meet the ever-changing landscape of security research and new demands from consumers, enterprises, governments, defense and other industries.
</p>

<p>
HASP is intended to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry, to share practical implementations and experiences related to all aspects of hardware and architectural support for security and privacy, and to discuss future trends in research and applications. To that end, papers are solicited from the areas, including, but not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Secure hardware architectures for smart phones and smart devices</li>
<li>Hardware-enhanced cloud security</li>
<li>Security and privacy aware sensors and sensor networks</li>
<li>Hardware-support for secure Internet-of-things</li>
<li>Hardware and architectural support for trust management</li>
<li>Hardware trojan threat evaluation, detection, and prevention</li>
<li>Hardware backdoors and countermeasures</li>
<li>Security simulation, testing, validation and verification</li>
<li>Architectural and hardware techniques for supporting digital forensics</li>
<li>Biometric hardware and implementation</li>
<li>Cyber war attack and defense techniques</li>
<li>Side-channel exploits, modeling and countermeasures
<li>Attack-resilient hardware and architectural design
<li>Hardware techniques for homeland security
<li>Supply chain security
<li>Cryptographic hardware design, implementation, and evaluation
<li>FPGA security
<li>Hardware based electronic and digital spoofing attacks
<li>Analysis of real attacks and threat evaluation
</ul>

<p>
In addition to regular research papers, authors are also invited to submit position papers or systemization-of-knowledge papers. 
Position papers should define new problems in hardware or architecture security and privacy topics.  Titles of position papers should be prefixed with "Postition Paper:".
Systemization-of-knowledge papers should consicely, but exhaustively, systematize and conceptualize existing knowledge (similar to SoK papers in S&amp;P conferences, but focusing on hardware and architecture).  Titles of Systemization-of-knowledge papers should be prefixed with "SoK:".</p>
<br />
