<h2>EENG 201 Introduction to Computer Engineering</h2>

<div class="header">Lab Projects</div>

<p>
The EENG 201 course includes 5 lab projects and and final project (lab 6).  Labs are done individually, while final project (lab 6) can be done individually or in groups of two students.  Students will be assigned to a 2 hour lab period when they will meet with the instructor or TA who will explain the particular lab.
Labs are divided into weekly checkpoints, some labs are only 1 week, thus only 1 checkpoint, while other labs take multiple weeks and have multiple checkpoints.  Each lab checkpoint can be usually finished in the 2 hour lab period.  However, they will be usually due at 5pm EST on the following Thursday so students needing more time can work on them longer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab equipment:</b>
Labs are located in Becton C041 students are free to use the room during the assigned lab period as well as on their own time.
The labs require use of Quartus II Web Edition software (free for download from Altera) and the DE1 FPGA boards.  Each workstation in C041 has an FPGA board.  Please do not remove the FPGA boards from the room.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lab Etiquette:</b>
As C041 is a shared room, please help keep the room clean, push in chairs, turn off monitors and lights when not in use.  Part of the course grade is based on how well students help maintain clean lab environment.
